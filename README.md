# UFOs
## Project Overview
This project is to help Dana to build a dynamic webpage that shows the UFO sighting informations. The webpage provides a search button for visitors to filter the results based on the inputs from date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary
Overall the website is working but with restrictions. The element typed in the placeholder has to be perfectly matched to the data and it's case sensitive (lower case only). If you accidently type in uppercase, it will appear to be no matching result.
